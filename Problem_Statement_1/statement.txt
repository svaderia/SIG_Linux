On alpha.wallhaven.cc, every image is given a number between 1 and 999999 and the URL is of the form: https://wallpapers.wallhaven.cc/wallpapers/full/wallhaven-*X*.jpg or https://wallpapers.wallhaven.cc/wallpapers/full/wallhaven-*X*.png. Where _X_ is our number.

Make a script such that:

When wallp 89399 or any other number is typed in the Linux terminal, https://wallpapers.wallhaven.cc/wallpapers/full/wallhaven-89399.jpg (892kB) will be set as the Wallpaper.
